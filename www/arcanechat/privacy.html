              <h3>Detailed data protection information</h3>
              <h4>1. Name and contact information of the data controller</h4>
              <p>Responsible for the processing of your personal data is</p>
              <pre><code>    Asiel Diaz Benitez
    Reichsgrafen Str. 20

              <h4>2. Processing when using the ArcaneChat e-mail messenger</h4>
              <p>
                All data is stored locally on your device or with your e-mail
                provider. Neither we nor ArcaneChat developers have any
                possibility to access the end user's data, as all communication
                is end-to-end encrypted. Only for the optional Push Notification
                (see 2.2) the Push Notification Token is processed by the
                ArcaneChat server.
              </p>
              <h5>2.1 Sign up with your e-mail provider</h5>
              <p>
                ArcaneChat communication works through your e-mail account. In
                order to establish the connection, the app needs the access
                data. These are only stored locally on your end device:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>e-mail address</li>
                <li>your password</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The legal basis for the processing is
                <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/"
                  >Art.6 (1) lit.b GDPR</a
                >, as you have a usage contract with us by using our services.
              </p>
              <p>
                Security procedures are in place to protect the confidentiality
                of the data: Only the bare data needed to fulfil the user
                request of login are stored, encryption takes place as well as
                local sandboxing, see 2.3 for further details.
              </p>
              <h5>2.2 Heartbeat push notification</h5>
              <p>
                Push notifications can be sent to the user's phone at regular
                intervals to enable receipt of messages while the ArcaneChat app
                is not currently active. Current messages can then be retrieved
                on the end device.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to use push notifications, a unique identifier or token
                (Push Notification Token) is created after the app is downloaded
                and installed. This token allows ArcaneChat server to send
                notifications to the user's device. The token is then stored on
                our systems and sent to the device at regular intervals to cause
                the app to retrieve new messages.
              </p>
              <h5>2.3 Data in the app</h5>
              <p>
                The ArcaneChat app works in a data-saving way. All relevant data
                is stored exclusively on the respective end devices:
              </p>
              <pre><code>- chat histories (text messages, voice messages, media, ...).
- contacts
- settings</code></pre>
              <p>
                ArcaneChat servers have no access to this data, as data
                processing takes place only on the end devices.
              </p>
              <h5>2.4 App permissions</h5>
              <p>
                Within the app, you can enter, manage, and edit various
                information, tasks, and activities. The app also requires the
                following permissions:

              <p>
                ArcaneChat server neither asks for nor retains personal
                information. ArcaneChat server exist to reliably transmit (store
                and deliver) end-to-end encrypted messages between user's
                devices running the ArcaneChat messenger app.
              </p>
              <p>ArcaneChat server:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>

                Nevertheless, we provide legal details below to make life easier
                for data protection specialists and lawyers scrutinizing the
                server's operations.
              </p>
              <h4>1. Name and contact information</h4>
              <p>
                Responsible for the processing of your personal data is:
                <code>Asiel Diaz Benitez</code>
              </p>
              <p>E-mail: adb@arcanechat.me</p>
              <h4>2. Processing when using ArcaneChat services</h4>
              <p>
                We provide services optimized for the use from
                <a href="https://arcanechat.me">ArcaneChat</a> apps and process
                only the data necessary for the setup and technical execution of
                message delivery. The purpose of the processing is that users
                can read, write, manage, delete, send, and receive chat
                messages. For this purpose, we operate server-side software that
                enables us to send and receive messages.
              </p>
              <p>We process the following data and details:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Outgoing and incoming messages (SMTP) are stored for transit
                    on behalf of their users until the message can be delivered.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    E-Mail-Messages are stored for the recipient and made
                    accessible via IMAP protocols, until explicitly deleted by
                    the user or until a fixed time period is exceeded, (<em
                      >usually 4-8 weeks</em
                    >).
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    IMAP and SMTP protocols are password protected with unique
                    credentials for each account.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Users can retrieve or delete all stored messages without
                    intervention from the operators using standard IMAP client
                    tools.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Users can connect to a "realtime relay service" to establish
                    Peer-to-Peer connection between user devices, allowing them
                    to send and retrieve ephemeral messages which are never
                    stored on the ArcaneChat server, also not in encrypted form.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>2.1 Account setup</h5>
              <p>
                Creating an account happens in one of two ways on our mail
                servers:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    with a QR invitation token which is scanned using the
                    ArcaneChat app and then the account is created.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    by letting ArcaneChat otherwise create an account and
                    register it with a arcanechat.me mail server.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In either case, we process the newly created email address. No
                phone numbers, other email addresses, or other identifiable data
                is currently required. The legal basis for the processing is
                Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR, as you have a usage contract with us by
                using our services.
              </p>
              <h5>2.2 Processing of E-Mail-Messages</h5>
              <p>
                In addition, we will process data to keep the server
                infrastructure operational for purposes of e-mail dispatch and
                abuse prevention.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Therefore, it is necessary to process the content and/or
                    metadata (e.g., headers of the email as well as smtp
                    chatter) of E-Mail-Messages in transit.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    We will keep logs of messages in transit for a limited time.
                    These logs are used to debug delivery problems and software
                    bugs.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In addition, we process data to protect the systems from
                excessive use. Therefore, limits are enforced:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>rate limits</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>storage limits</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>message size limits</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    any other limit necessary for the whole server to function
                    in a healthy way and to prevent abuse.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The processing and use of the above permissions are performed to
                provide the service. The data processing is necessary for the
                use of our services, therefore the legal basis of the processing
                is Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR, as you have a usage contract with us
                by using our services. The legal basis for the data processing
                for the purposes of security and abuse prevention is Art. 6 (1)
                lit. f GDPR. Our legitimate interest results from the
                aforementioned purposes. We will not use the collected data for
                the purpose of drawing conclusions about your person.

                selected (Art. 28 (1) GDPR) and with whom we have concluded a
                corresponding contract on commissioned processing (Art. 28 (3)
                GDPR), which obliges our contractor, among other things, to

                comprehensive control powers.
