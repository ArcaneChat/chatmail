              </ul>
              <p>
                Due to the resulting lack of personal data processing this
                server may not require a privacy policy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nevertheless, we provide legal details below to make life easier
                for data protection specialists and lawyers scrutinizing the
                server's operations.
              </p>
              <h4>1. Name and contact information</h4>
              <p>
                Responsible for the processing of your personal data is:
                <code>Asiel Diaz Benitez</code>
              </p>

              <h4>2. Processing when using ArcaneChat services</h4>
              <p>
                We provide services optimized for the use from
                <a href="https://arcanechat.me">ArcaneChat</a> apps and process
                only the data necessary for the setup and technical execution of
                message delivery. The purpose of the processing is that users
                can read, write, manage, delete, send, and receive chat
                messages. For this purpose, we operate server-side software that
                enables us to send and receive messages.
              </p>
              <p>We process the following data and details:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Outgoing and incoming messages (SMTP) are stored for transit
                    on behalf of their users until the message can be delivered.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    E-Mail-Messages are stored for the recipient and made
                    accessible via IMAP protocols, until explicitly deleted by
                    the user or until a fixed time period is exceeded, (<em
                      >usually 4-8 weeks</em
                    >).
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    IMAP and SMTP protocols are password protected with unique
                    credentials for each account.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Users can retrieve or delete all stored messages without
                    intervention from the operators using standard IMAP client
                    tools.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Users can connect to a "realtime relay service" to establish
                    Peer-to-Peer connection between user devices, allowing them
                    to send and retrieve ephemeral messages which are never
                    stored on the ArcaneChat server, also not in encrypted form.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>2.1 Account setup</h5>
              <p>
                Creating an account happens in one of two ways on our mail
                servers:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    with a QR invitation token which is scanned using the
                    ArcaneChat app and then the account is created.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    by letting ArcaneChat otherwise create an account and
                    register it with a arcanechat.me mail server.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In either case, we process the newly created email address. No
                phone numbers, other email addresses, or other identifiable data
                is currently required. The legal basis for the processing is
                Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR, as you have a usage contract with us by
                using our services.
              </p>
              <h5>2.2 Processing of E-Mail-Messages</h5>
              <p>
                In addition, we will process data to keep the server
                infrastructure operational for purposes of e-mail dispatch and
                abuse prevention.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Therefore, it is necessary to process the content and/or
                    metadata (e.g., headers of the email as well as smtp
                    chatter) of E-Mail-Messages in transit.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    We will keep logs of messages in transit for a limited time.
                    These logs are used to debug delivery problems and software
                    bugs.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In addition, we process data to protect the systems from
                excessive use. Therefore, limits are enforced:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>rate limits</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>storage limits</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>message size limits</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    any other limit necessary for the whole server to function
                    in a healthy way and to prevent abuse.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The processing and use of the above permissions are performed to
                provide the service. The data processing is necessary for the
                use of our services, therefore the legal basis of the processing
                is Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR, as you have a usage contract with us
                by using our services. The legal basis for the data processing
                for the purposes of security and abuse prevention is Art. 6 (1)
                lit. f GDPR. Our legitimate interest results from the
                aforementioned purposes. We will not use the collected data for
                the purpose of drawing conclusions about your person.

              <h4>4. Transfer of Data</h4>
              <p>
                We do not retain any personal data but e-mail messages waiting
                to be delivered may contain personal data. Any such residual
                personal data will not be transferred to third parties for
                purposes other than those listed below:
              </p>
              <p>
                a) you have given your express consent in accordance with Art. 6
                para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR,
              </p>
              <p>
                b) the disclosure is necessary for the assertion, exercise or
                defence of legal claims pursuant to Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f
                GDPR and there is no reason to assume that you have an
                overriding interest worthy of protection in the non-disclosure
                of your data,
              </p>
              <p>
                c) in the event that there is a legal obligation to disclose
                your data pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c GDPR, as
                well as
              </p>
              <p>
                d) this is legally permissible and necessary in accordance with
                Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. b GDPR for the processing of
                contractual relationships with you,
              </p>
              <p>
                e) this is carried out by a service provider acting on our
                behalf and on our exclusive instructions, whom we have carefully
                selected (Art. 28 (1) GDPR) and with whom we have concluded a
                corresponding contract on commissioned processing (Art. 28 (3)
                GDPR), which obliges our contractor, among other things, to
                implement appropriate security measures and grants us
                comprehensive control powers.
              </p>
              <h4>5. Rights of the data subject</h4>
              <p>
                The rights arise from Articles 12 to 23 GDPR. Since no personal
                data is stored on our servers, even in encrypted form, there is
                no need to provide information on these or possible objections.
                A deletion can be made directly in the ArcaneChat email
                messenger.
              </p>
